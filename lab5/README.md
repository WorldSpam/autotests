# Fifth lab

I didn't get how to use keycode alliases and do taps, but 3 tests are done (But they were counted as 1)

## How to use:
- Pull
- I don't know exactly, but most probably just run `npm install` in appium-wdio directory
- Enter suitable capabilities in wdio.conf.js
- Run `npm run wdio` to do the magic

## Preview of results (only last entries):
